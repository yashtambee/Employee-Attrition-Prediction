# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Employee attrition, also known as employee turnover, refers to the loss of employees from an organization. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including retirement, resignation, or termination. High levels of employee attrition can have a negative impact on an organization, as it can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, as well as a loss of knowledge and experience.

There are a number of factors that can contribute to employee attrition, including job dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities, poor management, and low pay.
Organizations can use Machine Learning  to predict employee attrition.

Classification algorithm "RandomForestClassifier" can be used to predict the attrition. These algorithm can be trained on historical data to identify patterns and trends that are associated with a higher risk of employee turnover. 

With the help of these predictions, organizations can take steps to improve employee retention, such as offering more training and development opportunities, improving management practices, and increasing compensation.
