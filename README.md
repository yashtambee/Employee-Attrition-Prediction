# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
### Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the prediction of employee attrition using Random Forest algorithm. 

Attrition, or the loss of employees from a company, can have a significant impact on a business productivity and bottom line. 

By accurately identifying employees who are at risk of leaving a company, employers can take steps to retain valuable employees and mitigate the negative effects of attrition.

### Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on current employees, including factors such as job satisfaction,relations satisfaction,percent salary hike,overtime and many more other factors. 

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values and categorical variables.

### Algorithm
The Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble learning technique that combines the predictions of several decision trees once they have been constructed, is used in this research. 

Random Forest is viewed as a potential alternative for staff attrition prediction since it can handle high-dimensional and unbalanced information.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.0 
 
- scikit-learn 

- pandas 

- numpy

### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository

2. Install the required dependencies

3. Run the command python main.py to train and evaluate the model

4. Or open the code in google colab & run all cells (press Ctrl + F9)

The model can be used to predict the risk of attrition for new employees by passing their information as input to the trained model

### Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing dataset.

### Conclusion
Using Random Forest to predict employee attrition can be quite advantageous for businesses. 

Employers can take action to retain valuable employees and lessen the negative consequences of attrition by precisely identifying employees who are at danger of leaving a company. 

A deeper knowledge of the underlying causes and the creation of retention strategies might result from using the model to find patterns and connections between the variables that affect employee turnover.
